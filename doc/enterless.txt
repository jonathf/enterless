OVERVIEW                                                             *enterless*

Enterless is an extention to the minimalist filebrowser Dirvish. This modules
requires that Dirvish is installed to function.

Enterless' main feature is a forward search system that allows with a minimum
of key presses to access any files on the filesystems.  It does so by
completing any path as much as possible and automatically enters folders and
files when unbiquitous.  For example, using default mappings,
  :Enterless ~~
will start the directory viewer and list files in you home folder. Lets assume
that the following folders are pressent:
  bar/
  foo/
  foobar/
By pressing 'b', Enterless, will automatically enter the folder bar and list
its content. This is because bar is the only folder starting with the letter
b. If bar was a file, the file would instead be opened.

If however 'f' is pressed, two things happens.
1. The cursor jumps down to the first ouccurence of the file with prefix 'f'.
2. Each filename starting with 'f' is highlighted.
To enter the folder foo/, one could either press '/' to complete the path, or
press <CR>. Equivalently for foobar/, one could press 'b' for completion or
'<DOWN><CR>' for cursor move and enter.

If more files and folders have partially common names that prohibits
completion on two presses, this method works recursivly until only one name is
selected.

INSTALL                                                               *dirvish*

Enterless is built upon Dirvish, so dirvish must be installed first.

API                                                              *enterless-api*

:Enterless                                                          *:Enterless*
    Open the |current-directory|.

:Enterless {path}
    Open the directory at {path}, or its parent directory if {path} is a file.
    To open the directory of the current file: >
        :Enterless %

MAPPINGS                                                    *enterless-mappings*

Enterless provides these default buffer-local mappings and commands.

    
    <F12>           Quit Enterless and return to the original file.
    <CR>            Open file.
    <F2>            Reload folder
    a-z.-_/         Search forward and enter fold/file if found
    <BS>            Abort search forward. If no search is found, go to parent
                    folder.
    <C-d>           Delete current file/folder.
    <C-r>           Rename current file/folder.
    <C-e>           Execute current file as script.
    <C-f>           Create a new folder.

If default mappings isn't what you want, there are many options to redefined
them. For searching forward mappings, see |enterless-options| for various
unmappings.

To redefine mappings, the following plugs are provided.

    <plug>(enterless_backwards)     Cancel search or jump folder down (<BS>).
    <plug>(enterless_open)          Open file (<CR>).
    <plug>(enterless_quit)          Quit Enterless (<F12>).
    <plug>(enterless_reload)        Reload folder (<F2>).
    <plug>(enterless_deletefile)    Delete file (<C-d>).
    <plug>(enterless_renamefile)    Rename file (<C-r>).
    <plug>(enterless_executescript) Execute script (<C-e>).
    <plug>(enterless_createfolder)  Create folder (<C-f>).

In addition, each key 'a' through 'z', 'A' through 'Z', '0' through '9' and
'.', '-', '_' and '/' has their own plug map:

    <plug>(enterless_#)         Search forward, where '#' is replaced with the
                                various keys
